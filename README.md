# :tomato: Pomodoro Timer

A small web-based Pomodoro timer built using react, typescript, and some components from the MUI library. It will create a countdown for each pomodoro and will wrap up the interval with a sound effect notifying the user that the next interval is about to begin.

It creates a small jumping point to allow me to add some small features on to it.

## Personal Comments

My partner mentioned using pomodoro timers to help her focus on tasks, and I wanted to see if I could program one (even if there are many of these on the internet). Coming from some more experience working with React, I wanted to see if I could flex my skills with my own project while adding Typescript on so that I can practice.

Overall I'm very happy with how this came out in such a short period of time. Especially with having the sound effect which arguably makes the application usable at its core.
